                            to this career being determined to produce high-quality software, improving upon current skills and learning new skills, and being motivated to
                            see through the task at hand. </p>
                            <p>During the course of my life I have been involved in different industries including the hospitality- and international relations industry. It tought me
                            the importance of communication and how relations can influence success. This is also important for software engineering since teamwork is a vital
                            aspect.</p>
                            <p>I believe one should keep active in terms of a healthy body and mind. Training and traveling is therefore important, but to keep a balance I enjoy
                            volunteering to keep South Africa rivers clean. For further self-improvement I enjoy public-speaking meetings. As always, I am optimistic that I can
                            play a role to make a difference wether it is in my career or just in the everyday lives of people.</p>
